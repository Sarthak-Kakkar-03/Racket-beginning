;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; Remember back in school when you had to remember various math facts like the
; multiplication table? Well, let's make an animation that will quickly show
; off DrRacket's multiplication skills.

; TODO 1/1: Define a humble-square function that, when called by animate
;
;           (animate humble-square)
;
;           counts up the perfect squares in the following way: the first
;           frame is...
;
;           0 squared is 0
;
;           then...
;
;           1 squared is 1
;
;           then ...
;
;           2 squared is 4
;
;           and so on, for as long as the program runs.
;
;           Hints:
;           - Since animate produces frames 28 times a second, it'll likely
;             go too fast for you to see... hence the humble brag ;)
;           - The size of the animate window will always stay the same, so
;             you should make a background big enough to handle the growing
;             size of numbers/squares.
;           - Don't forget reasonable signature & purpose statements!
;           - As usual, have fun with colors/fonts/background, but make sure
;             the result is useful, readable, and respectful :)
;SIGNATURE: Number->Animation
;PURPOSE: The function produces an animation
;which tells you the square of numerical values
;between 0 to infinity
(define t (add1 0))
 
(define (squares t)
  (string-append (number->string t) " " "squared is" " " (number->string (* t t))))


(define (number-shown t)
  (text (squares t) 30 "red"))
(define background
  (square 500 "solid" "black"))
(define (humble-square t)
  (overlay (number-shown t) background))

(animate humble-square)
